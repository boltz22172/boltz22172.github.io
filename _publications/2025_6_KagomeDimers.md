Preprint: [arXiv:2506.21255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21255). 

Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We analyze the thin-cylinder limit and then develop a matrix product representation on arbitrary cylinders, leading to a natural protocol to efficiently grow these states.
