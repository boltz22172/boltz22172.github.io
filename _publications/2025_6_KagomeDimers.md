**Accepted by *Physical Review A*.** 

Preprint: [arXiv:2506.21255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21255). 

Motivated by Rydberg-atom experiments, we studied tensor-network representations of the Rokhsar–Kivelson state on the kagome lattice, and designed a novel sequential generation algorithm, which is more efficient and experimentally friendly than existing approaches.
