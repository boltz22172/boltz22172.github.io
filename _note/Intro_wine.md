  <strong>Wine</strong><br>
  Wine is a quiet dialogue between earth and time, carrying the memory of sun, soil, and seasons within a single glass. It invites patience and attention, revealing depth not through force, but through balance, nuance, and lingering grace.<br><br>

In the fall of 2024, I took *Introduction to Wines* (HADM 4300) at Cornell’s [Nolan School of Hotel](https://sha.cornell.edu/). With Ms. Stanley, “fermentation” started to feel less like a process and more like a philosophy. I’d call it one of the best introductory wine courses in the world, even though those tongue-twisting wine terms often left me half-awake in class—holding a glass like a sleepwalker and nodding as if I truly grasped the meaning of “Cabernet Sauvignon” and “Pinot Noir.”

The more dangerous (and more fun) part was that, my friends **Mav, Rilke, and Celeste** and I formed a little “tasting alliance”. We’d raise our glasses and complain: *this tannin is kind of awful*. A session could easily mean six pours, and if I actually finished them all, I rarely stayed coherent. Electronics were banned, so we cultivated a higher art instead: sneaking quick looks at our phones whenever the TA’s attention drifted, and smuggling boredom (and whatever we didn’t catch) through those narrow windows. When your listening can’t quite keep up, time needs a bit of “digital aging.”

I miss the dinners after class: walking from **Statler Hall** to **Morrison**, from hillsides of autumn leaves into real snow. Along the way we talked from wine to investing, quantum physics, and love. Only later did I realize that friendship and wine really do speak to each other—both growing longer, softer, and more resonant in the finish.

I miss the days that felt like **Riesling**—bright and clear, with a playful edge of acidity, and a finish that goes on and on, long enough that even now I want to open another bottle.

## Dedicated to those days like wine.
