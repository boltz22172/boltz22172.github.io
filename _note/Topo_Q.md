  <strong>Topological Quantum</strong><br>
  Topology frames quantum physics in terms of global structures: inherently quantum features such as phase and entanglement naturally demand topological descriptions beyond local geometry. This perspective has become central to both field theory and condensed matter, where topology organizes universal low-energy behavior and phases beyond symmetry breaking. At the same time, it underpins key ideas in quantum technology, providing intrinsically robust principles for quantum matter, quantum memories, and fault-tolerant quantum computation.<br><br>

These are my self-study notes written during the spring of 2026, based on Prof. Simon’s  
[*Topological Quantum*](https://academic.oup.com/book/55346).
