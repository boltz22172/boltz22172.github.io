  <strong>Statistical Physics of Fields</strong><br>
  Statistical field theory reframes statistical physics in the language of fields: coarse-graining turns microscopic degrees of freedom into collective variables, and fluctuations become the central actor. This perspective links models to universal behavior through correlation functions and the renormalization group.<br><br>

These are my self-study notes written during the winter of 2024, while I was at Cornell, based on  Prof. Kardar’s  
[*Statistical Physics of Fields*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/statistical-physics-of-fields/06F49D11030FB3108683F413269DE945).

The book adopts a distinctly modern perspective and is particularly well suited for a second pass through statistical mechanics. At the same time, it is not always easy to read, and some derivations are nontrivial for beginners. I hope these notes may be of some help.
