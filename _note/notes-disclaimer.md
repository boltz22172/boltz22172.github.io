These notes are my personal working notes. If you find them useful, I would be very happy. You are welcome to email me for discussion.

Please note that these notes may contain mistakes, including (but not limited to) typos, calculation errors, or even factual errors. Although I strive to be accurate, these are notes rather than formal publications. If you notice any issues, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know.

Please do not widely redistribute these notes, and please do not use them for commercial purposes.
