These are my course notes for *Cold Atom Physics* taught by Prof. Hui Zhai at Tsinghua University.

The course follows, at least in part, the textbook  
[*Ultracold Atomic Physics*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ultracold-atomic-physics/F47F9C80F9AF593E66A1942B0EA513C4)  
by Cambridge University Press.
