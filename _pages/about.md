I am a senior undergraduate student at [Zhili College](https://www.zlc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), majoring in *Fundamental Science of Mathematics and Physics*. My research interests focus on the theoretical study of emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems, and on how related theoretical advances may contribute to technological progress. I have received research training in the group of Prof. Erich Mueller at [Cornell University](https://www.lassp.cornell.edu/erich-mueller-group) and in the group of Prof. Yi-Zhuang You at [University of California, San Diego](https://everettyou.github.io/).
